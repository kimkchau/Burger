# Burger
Eat-Da-Burger is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they would like to eat.  When the user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page where it's waiting to be devoured.  Each burger in the waiting area also has a "Devour it!" button.  When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page.  The app stores every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
